# Limitations

SV-Gap v0.1 intentionally favors auditable conclusions over broad coverage.

- The built-in reference oracle recognizes only documented structural shapes.
- Yosys elaboration can erase or transform source-level intent.
- Yosys 0.66 rejects some SystemVerilog function syntax accepted by Icarus
  Verilog 13.0; these cases are reported as `tool_error`, not design failures.
- Clock and reset metadata are supplied by the evaluator and may be wrong.
- Safe CDC is protocol-dependent; structure alone cannot prove every protocol.
- Gray recognition checks a declared signal and XOR-based source cone; it does
  not formally prove single-bit transition behavior for all reachable states.
- Functional tests do not model analog metastability.
- A clean report is not evidence of silicon signoff.
- Findings require expert review before being described as field failures.
- Structural `pass` means that the configured narrow rules emitted no finding;
  it does not establish a true negative. Gated or inverted resets, async
  set/reset cells, mux hazards, and broader protocols remain incomplete.
- Benchmark interface/scoring detection is heuristic. Reported negative counts
  are not a validated census until negative samples are manually reviewed.
- The core evaluator and shipped EDA dependencies are open source, but the
  generation study and synthetic robustness panel used proprietary model
  endpoints. Their prompts, normalized artifacts, schemas, and analysis code
  are public; exact model replay is not an open-tool-only workflow and is not a
  runtime dependency of SV-Gap.

The absence of a mature, broadly accessible open-source CDC/RDC signoff tool is
itself an ecosystem limitation. SV-Gap therefore keeps checker execution behind
a backend boundary rather than presenting its reference oracle as comprehensive.
