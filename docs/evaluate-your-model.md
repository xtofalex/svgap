# Evaluate your model

!!! danger "Generated RTL is untrusted code"
    The local evaluator is not a security sandbox. A generated candidate is
    processed by external EDA tools and may contain simulator system tasks.
    Do not evaluate untrusted RTL on a workstation containing credentials or
    sensitive source trees. Use the isolated two-stage container path below for
    model or contributor outputs you have not inspected.

This is the end-to-end recipe for running your own model — an internal
checkpoint, an API endpoint, or any local runtime — through an SV-Gap
taskpack and producing the same layered result the published studies use.
No provider CLI is required.

Read the [research protocol](research-protocol.md) and
[research scope](research-scope-v0.2.md) before interpreting numbers. The
output is a taskpack-conditional detection count with explicit `unknown`
states, not a defect rate or a leaderboard entry.

## What the harness needs from you

One thing: a way to turn a task prompt into a model response. The contract is
deliberately minimal —

- the prompt arrives on **stdin**;
- the response (containing the RTL, fenced or bare) goes to **stdout**;
- a nonzero exit means generation failed for that task.

Everything else — response normalization, manifest construction, functional
simulation, structural checking, provenance hashes — is the harness's job.

## Path A: one command over a whole taskpack

Wrap your model in any executable. For an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# my_generate.py — stdin: prompt, stdout: response
import os, sys
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url=os.environ.get("MY_BASE_URL"))
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=os.environ["MY_MODEL"],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": sys.stdin.read()}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Then run the reset-release taskpack (eight tasks, three samples each):

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_generation_pilot.py command \
  --command "python3 my_generate.py" \
  --label my-model-a \
  --interface-label "my-lab-harness 1.0" \
  --task-root taskpacks/reset-replication-v0.2/tasks \
  --tasks reset_config reset_counter reset_credits reset_events \
          reset_fsm reset_status reset_timer reset_watchdog \
  --samples 3 \
  --output reports/generated/my-model-study
```

Environment variables (API keys, endpoints) pass through to your command.
The prompt is never placed on the command line, and the recorded provenance
contains your command string and interface label — not your credentials.

Do not place credentials directly in `--command`: the command string is
retained as provenance. Prefer environment variables supplied to the generator.

## Recommended: separate generation from isolated evaluation

Generate responses in the credentialed host environment without invoking any
EDA tool:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_generation_pilot.py command \
  --command "python3 my_generate.py" \
  --label my-model-a \
  --interface-label "my-lab-harness 1.0" \
  --task-root taskpacks/reset-replication-v0.2/tasks \
  --tasks reset_config reset_counter reset_credits reset_events \
          reset_fsm reset_status reset_timer reset_watchdog \
  --samples 3 \
  --generate-only \
  --output reports/generated/my-model-study
```

Then evaluate only the saved responses in a disposable, network-disabled
container. The evaluation container receives no model credentials and cannot
read the rest of the repository:

```bash
mkdir -p reports/evaluated/my-model-study

docker run --rm \
  --network none \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop ALL \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --pids-limit 256 \
  --memory 4g \
  --cpus 2 \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,nosuid,size=512m \
  -v "$PWD/reports/generated/my-model-study/_responses:/responses:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/taskpacks/reset-replication-v0.2/tasks:/tasks:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/reports/evaluated/my-model-study:/output:rw" \
  --entrypoint python \
  ghcr.io/shsridhar-beep/svgap:v0.3.0-alpha.3 \
  /opt/svgap/scripts/evaluate_saved_responses.py \
  --responses /responses \
  --task-root /tasks \
  --output /output
```

Resource limits reduce accidental damage and denial-of-service risk; they do
not turn the reference evaluator into a formally verified sandbox. Apply your
organization's approved isolation controls for hostile-input evaluation.

## Path B: bring pre-generated responses

If generation already happened elsewhere, score each saved response directly:

```bash
svgap pilot taskpacks/reset-replication-v0.2/tasks/reset_counter \
  response.txt --model my-model-a --run-id my-model-a--sample-01 \
  --output reports/generated/my-model-study
```

`pilot` normalizes the response, materializes the candidate with the task's
declared intent, runs the functional testbench and the structural oracle, and
writes a schema-validated `report.json`.

## Aggregate and read the result

```bash
svgap summarize reports/generated/my-model-study
svgap gap reports/generated/my-model-study/*/*/report.json
svgap export reports/generated/my-model-study/*/*/report.json \
  --html my-model-study.html
svgap explain reports/generated/my-model-study/<run>/<task>/report.json
```

`summarize` is deterministic over the report set. `gap` prints the detected
structural-validity gap over functionally passing, structurally determinate
candidates. `explain` translates one report into answered, failed, and
unanswered production questions.

## Interpretation rules

- Repeated calls to one configuration are generation events, not independent
  samples; report per-task groupings, not just totals.
- Exact duplicate normalized outputs are disclosed by the summary; do not
  count them as independent evidence.
- `unknown` and `tool_error` are never structural passes. Report them.
- The number you get is conditional on this taskpack and the configured
  rules. It does not rank models or estimate population prevalence.

## Withheld model identifiers

If your lab cannot name a checkpoint, use a stable configuration alias as the
`--label` and record the true identifier privately. The published studies use
this pattern themselves (`openai-frontier-a` is such an alias); the report
schema treats labels as opaque configuration names.

## Gate a generation pipeline in CI

`svgap check` exits nonzero on failing, unknown, or tool-error outcomes by
default. To gate only on the headline condition — functionally accepted but
structurally failing RTL:

```bash
svgap check candidate/manifest.toml --fail-on gap
```

`--fail-on report-only` writes the report and never gates. Exit codes:
`0` pass, `1` fail, `2` tool or manifest error, `3` unknown.
