# `reference-naja` structural backend

`reference-naja` is a second built-in structural checker that reproduces the
`reference-yosys` CDC/RDC oracle on a different toolchain. It is registered under
the `svgap.backends` entry point as `reference-naja` and selected in a manifest
with:

```toml
[structural]
backend = "reference-naja"
```

This page documents what [docs/backend-sdk.md](backend-sdk.md) requires of any
contributed backend: license, install requirements, source-location behavior,
supported rules, timeout behavior, and known false-positive / false-negative
classes.

## License

The backend depends on **najaeda** (the Python distribution of the
[Naja](https://github.com/najaeda/naja) SNL/EDA project), which is
**Apache-2.0**. This is compatible with SV-Gap's own Apache-2.0 license. najaeda
is listed in
[THIRD_PARTY.md](https://github.com/shsridhar-beep/svgap/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY.md).

## Install requirements

The backend is opt-in. It is packaged as the optional `naja` extra:

```sh
pip install "svgap[naja]"
```

The default `pip install svgap` is unchanged and does not pull najaeda. When
the extra is absent, `svgap doctor` reports `reference-naja` as an optional
backend with the install command (without failing), and selecting the backend
in a manifest produces the same actionable error instead of a crash.

The practical differentiator from `reference-yosys` is *in-process operation
with no separately installed executable*: there is no Yosys and no Icarus
Verilog in this backend's path. najaeda is not a pure-Python package, though;
it distributes platform-specific compiled wheels bundling its native slang
SystemVerilog frontend and SNL netlist engine.

- `reference-yosys` shells out to the `yosys` executable and, for functional
  checks, `iverilog`/`vvp`; those are external system packages.
- `reference-naja` runs entirely in-process against `from najaeda import naja`.

Wheels for najaeda 0.7.16 cover Linux x86_64/aarch64 (manylinux 2.28), macOS
arm64, and Windows x86_64; other platforms need a source build of Naja.
(Functional simulation is unaffected and still uses Icarus; this backend only
replaces the *structural* oracle.)

The supported version range is `najaeda>=0.7.16,<0.8`. The backend uses
`SNLDesign.isMux()` (added in 0.7.13) instead of an earlier `naja_mux*`
name-prefix heuristic, and relies on 0.7.16 side-effect defaults (no
performance report unless `NAJA_PERF` is set, `diagnostics_report_path`
honored as given). najaeda is pre-1.0, so minor releases may move the API;
the ceiling is deliberate. Each result records the exact najaeda version in
`tool_versions` provenance.

## Source-location behavior

Findings carry a `source_location` in `file:line` form derived from najaeda's
SNL source-location metadata (slang's diagnostics-engine convention), when
available. najaeda records the path relative to the *calling process's* current
working directory, unlike Yosys's always-absolute `src` attribute. The backend
normalizes this to an absolute path and then strips the manifest directory
prefix, so the emitted location is relative to the manifest directory and
independent of the caller's cwd (matching the candidate-relative locations the
rest of SV-Gap emits). If najaeda has no source location for an instance, the
field is an empty string rather than a fabricated location.

## Supported rules

| Rule | Covered |
|---|---|
| REF-CDC-001 (async crossing without recognized second stage) | yes |
| REF-CDC-002 (combinational logic before synchronizer) | yes |
| REF-CDC-003 (multi-bit crossing without coherence protocol) | yes |
| REF-RDC-001 (raw async reset into a sync-deassertion element) | yes |
| REF-XPROP-001 (power-on X) | **no — not implemented** |

REF-XPROP-001 is explicitly out of scope for `reference-naja`. A manifest that
depends on power-on X analysis should use `reference-yosys`. The backend does
not silently pass power-on intent: a manifest that declares
`power_on = "reset_required"` is reported as `unknown`, with a diagnostic
naming the unimplemented rule. The `power_on_x` witness family is therefore
excluded from this backend's pass/fail test matrix; its abstention on both
witnesses is tested instead.

Missing or insufficient intent is reported as `unknown` (never `pass`), and an
elaboration or analysis failure is reported as `tool_error` (never `pass`),
matching the SDK contract.

## Frontend warnings and working-directory hygiene

Backend runs create no files in the caller's working directory. najaeda's
incremental diagnostics report is directed to a temporary file (parsed, then
removed), and its performance report is disabled unless `NAJA_PERF` is
explicitly set in the environment (an opt-in that follows najaeda's own
convention).

Warning-severity frontend diagnostics are not dropped: each one surfaces on
the `CheckResult` as a finding with `rule_id` `REF-NAJA-FRONTEND-001` and
`severity: warning`, carrying the stage, najaeda warning code, and normalized
`source_location` in its evidence. The most consequential is
`case_comparison_two_state`: slang lowers the case-equality operators
`===`/`!==` as 2-state comparisons in SNL, so the X/Z distinction is not
preserved, which affects how X/Z-sensitive RTL should be interpreted. Warning
findings never change the verdict; only error-severity findings do.

## Timeout behavior

**Known gap: the backend has no timeout.** `check()` calls
`db.loadSystemVerilog(...)` (slang elaboration) and the in-process netlist
analysis synchronously, with no wall-clock bound. A pathological or extremely
large source could therefore run unbounded. In practice the flat, single-module
CDC/RDC fixtures elaborate in milliseconds, but callers that run untrusted or
unbounded input should impose their own external timeout. `reference-yosys` has
the same characteristic (it does not time-bound the `yosys` subprocess either),
so this is not a regression relative to the built-in backend, but it is a real
limitation to close before running this backend on adversarial input.

## Known false-positive and false-negative classes

These are surfaced from the `ReferenceNajaBackend` class docstring and its
`_reset_synchronizer_regs` note so they live in the documentation, not only in
code comments.

- **Wide-vector reset synchronizer — resolved (was a measured false positive).**
  naja lowers a packed-vector reset synchronizer (`logic [1:0] reset_sync; ...`)
  as a single multi-bit sequential instance. `_reset_synchronizer_regs` now
  recognizes this wide single-instance form — a bit-0 inactive-constant load
  followed by a strict per-bit shift chain under one shared async reset, with
  each D bit resolved through its `assign` alias first — at parity with Yosys's
  "wide vector-shift `$adff` cell" fallback. Before this fallback was ported the
  wide form was flagged under REF-RDC-001 and was the single disagreement class
  in the [cross-oracle comparison](cross-oracle-naja-result.md): 18 of 72 frozen
  candidates, all one model configuration's coding style. With the fallback
  ported that comparison is 72/72 (it was 54/72). The match is deliberately
  narrow: an ordinary wide async-reset *data* register (whose D bits are external
  data, not a shift-to-constant chain) is still flagged. Designs that write the
  synchronizer as named scalar flops are recognized by the scalar path, as before.

- **Synchronous-reset polarity NOT gate — benign.** `if (!rst_n)` lowers, via
  slang, to an explicit NOT gate feeding a mux select, where Yosys's `proc` pass
  folds the polarity into the mux inputs with no NOT cell. This never changes a
  finding: the polarity NOT's fanin dead-ends at the reset port (no sequential
  driver), so it contributes no combinational-path entry under the
  trace-only-successful-branches walk.

- **Continuous net alias (`assign`) transparency.** `wire x = y;` lowers to an
  explicit `assign` leaf instance in naja (Yosys has no equivalent cell). The
  backend treats `assign` as transparent glue in both the backward and forward
  walks (crossed but never recorded), matching Yosys's hazard semantics, since
  it carries no real logic. A divergence here would be a false
  negative/positive; none has been observed, but it is a modeling assumption
  worth stating.

- **XOR vs. generic N-ary gate truth-table ambiguity.**
  `SNLDesign.getTruthTable()` cannot distinguish XOR/AND/OR/NAND/NOR/XNOR for
  naja's *generic* N-ary gate family (they share a `GenericType` tag rather than
  an explicit bit mask). The backend uses `SNLDesign.isXor()` for the Gray/XOR
  coherence check (REF-CDC-003) instead of a truth-table match. If a future naja
  release changed how that family is tagged, the Gray-protocol waiver logic
  would need re-validation.

## Tests

- `tests/test_reference_naja.py` — the four controlled safe/unsafe witness pairs
  and their rule IDs, the gray-declaration and wildcard-gray cases,
  missing-intent (`unknown`), unparseable/missing source (`tool_error`),
  report-schema validation, and the cross-oracle differential against the frozen
  72-candidate artifact.
- `tests/test_backends.py` — the capability probe (registry discovery and
  `load_backend`).
