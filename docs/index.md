# SV-Gap documentation

SV-Gap makes the gap between “passes the benchmark” and “reviewable by a
chip-design team” explicit for AI-generated digital RTL: LLM-written Verilog
and SystemVerilog, evaluated against declared design intent for clock-domain
crossing (CDC), reset-domain crossing (RDC), and power-on state.

## Start here

- [Name one production question your functional eval leaves unanswered](https://github.com/shsridhar-beep/svgap/issues/new?template=production_question.yml)
  (60 seconds, no install)
- [Inspect the controlled result without installing anything](controlled-result.md)
- [Create and interpret a local evidence profile](evaluate-your-model.md#first-create-and-read-an-evidence-profile)
- [Run one packaged model-evaluation task](evaluate-your-model.md)
- [Run or report the eight-task Harbor experiment](harbor.md)
- [Bring your own RTL](bring-your-own-rtl.md)
- [Integrate an existing benchmark](integrating-existing-benchmarks.md)
- [Study frontier-model handoff capability](frontier-model-research.md)
- [Request a research scoping call](https://github.com/shsridhar-beep/svgap/issues/new?template=collaboration.yml)
  or [email the maintainer](mailto:shsridhar@nvidia.com?subject=SV-Gap%20research%20call)
- [Explore the design-partner workflow](design-partner-workflow.md)

## Trust boundary

SV-Gap runs locally and performs no telemetry or artifact uploads. Generated
RTL and functional commands are untrusted input; use the
[network-disabled evaluation workflow](evaluate-your-model.md#recommended-separate-generation-from-isolated-evaluation)
for outputs you have not reviewed. Results are bounded evidence profiles, not
certification or silicon signoff.

## Copy-paste JSON demo

Use `--json` with `--output` when a CI job, issue, or agent benchmark needs a
machine-readable first result and a preserved reproducer:

```bash
svgap demo --json --output demo-output \
  | jq '{status, safe: .safe.structural, unsafe: .unsafe.structural, findings: .unsafe.findings}'
```

```json
{
  "findings": [
    "REF-RDC-001"
  ],
  "safe": "pass",
  "status": "pass",
  "unsafe": "fail"
}
```

Attach `demo-output/summary.json`, both `*/build/report.json` files, and the
preserved manifests/RTL sources when filing an issue or publishing a CI
artifact. Do not commit `demo-output`; it is generated evidence.

Claim boundary: this controlled witness shows that the supplied functional
oracle does not identify the structural reset-release finding. It is not a
defect-rate estimate or silicon signoff.
