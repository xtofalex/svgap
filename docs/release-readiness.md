# Public release readiness

Audit date: 2026-07-02

## Ready

- Apache-2.0 license, notice, and third-party inventory are present.
- The quickstart, limitations, security warning, contribution guide, and conduct
  policy are present.
- Forty-three tests pass with Yosys 0.66 and Icarus Verilog 13.0, including
  adversarial oracle and JSON Schema checks.
- A wheel builds and installs successfully in a clean temporary environment.
- The controlled witnesses, 508-task benchmark audit, exploratory pilot, and
  72-candidate reset replication have tracked summaries and interpretation
  boundaries.
- Raw provider responses, private adjudication mappings, and blinded review
  packets are excluded from Git. The normalized public candidate artifact is
  intentionally versioned.
- A secret-keyed 72-case v0.3 blinded adjudication packet has been generated locally and verified
  not to contain model names or automated outcomes.
- The locked eight-panel synthetic review reached nominal alpha `0.989`, exact
  15-yes/57-no consensus across all targets, and zero unresolved cases. It is
  reported as synthetic robustness evidence, not human validation.
- A deterministic 72-candidate bundle is versioned at
  `artifacts/reset-replication-v0.1`; manifest SHA-256 is
  `6a5205559bbe1640784236e3d5fcf412dc4b3899a5c7f90dc6e1abf486fbe6d7`.
- Seven scoped issues exist; the SARIF/HTML and reset-v0.2 issues were delivered
  in v0.2, while five contributor-facing issues remain open under the v0.3
  community-adoption milestone. See [starter-issues.md](starter-issues.md).
- The public repository is `https://github.com/shsridhar-beep/svgap`. Release
  `v0.1.0-alpha.1` is tagged, published on GitHub, and archived at Zenodo
  (`doi:10.5281/zenodo.21152349`).
- Zenodo concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21152348` identifies the project across
  versions; the v0.2 version DOI will be assigned after its GitHub release is
  ingested and must not be guessed in advance.
- Author identity, affiliation, ORCID, and contact are recorded in
  `CITATION.cff`.
- Publication of normalized generated RTL is authorized by the project author.
  Raw provider transcripts remain excluded.

## Decisions closed for the first public snapshot

1. Cite with full name, NVIDIA affiliation, and ORCID (superseding the earlier
   name-only entry).
2. Publish normalized generated RTL under the scoped artifact license; exclude
   raw provider transcripts and credentials.
3. Lock the two-repeat, four-configuration synthetic robustness panel before
   publishing model-labeled RTL. Do not call it human expert adjudication.
4. Tag `v0.1.0-alpha.1` (package version `0.1.0a1`), publish a GitHub Release,
   and archive it at Zenodo (superseding the earlier untagged-branch
   decision).

## Optional evidence for a stronger rate claim

Independent full-case human expert adjudication is required only before `14/57`
is described as a validated defect rate. Until then it is an author-confirmed
lower-bound demonstration count. This does not block the existential research
claim, framework release, or community launch. The blinded synthetic panel is a
robustness check, not a substitute; see
[synthetic adjudication](synthetic-adjudication.md).

Current blinded packet: `review_packets/reset-replication-v0.3.zip`, SHA-256
`942bcfc09d3aeafc834f64bdae69c07f08243351c332e36018d10077762655b9`.

No package-registry publication is part of this milestone; installation is
from source or the tagged archive.

## v0.2 alpha released

- The research scope is explicitly existential and no longer treats population
  estimation or human adjudication as a release gate.
- Existing functional verdicts can be imported with a digest binding them to
  the candidate source set.
- Third-party checker backends are discoverable through a documented entry
  point contract.
- Strict report validation, SARIF, static HTML, a composite GitHub Action, and a
  pinned OSS CAD Suite container are implemented.
- Reset taskpack v0.2 fixes the timer ambiguity and calibrates safe/unsafe
  references for all eight tasks in automated tests.
- Release automation builds wheels, source distributions, schemas, taskpack and
  result archives, checksums, and a multi-architecture GHCR image.

Tag `v0.2.0-alpha.1` and its GitHub prerelease were published from tested commit
`6839263`. The release carries a wheel, source distribution, schemas, v0.1
result archive, v0.2 taskpack archive, and SHA-256 manifest. Public `main`
requires the Python 3.11–3.13, package, and container checks; force pushes and
branch deletion are disabled. Zenodo ingestion occurs after the GitHub release,
so its version DOI is recorded only after Zenodo assigns it.
